This API does not take as argument the actual path to an SD stored in the WSO<sub>2</sub> GReg, but rather the service instance URI declared in an SD. It returns the SD in which that service instance is declared (note that there is an one-to-one mapping between SDs and service instances). This functionality is required for retrieving SDs from the Fuseki triple store implemented as part of the Broker@Cloud framework.</dd>

It then publishes the SD to the <code>SD</code> topic which passes it over to the SD validation mechanism provided by the Broker@Cloud framework. A submission report is then published on the <code>SDReport</code> topic which incorporates the URI of the service instance to which the SD corresponds and which also comprises a completeness report and a compliance report.

                        <p>The Broker@Cloud platform offers an API for service validation, verification and test generation. These three procedures have been implemented using the generic pub/sub system management API. As an example, for the service validation mechanism any interested party initially needs to subscribe to the <code>vttsValidationReport</code> topic in order to later receive the service validation report. Then, it publishes the service specification document to the <code>vttsValidation</code> topic. Upon validation completion, a relevant report is published on the <code>vttsValidationReport</code> topic. In an analogous manner, for the cases of service verification and test generation any interested party needs to use the <code>vttsVerificationReport</code>/<code>vttsVerification</code> and <code>vttsGenerationReport</code>/<code>vttsGeneration</code> topics respectively.</p>

Similarly, the service update and service deprecation events are emitted to the <code>serviceUpdated</code> and <code>serviceDeprecated</code> topics respectively.</p>

                    <p>The Broker@Cloud optimization component (called PuLSaR) enables service consumers to create preference profiles for service selection and based on them generate service recommendations matching each profile. It also collects feedback from service consumers and generates notifications to service providers about the opinion consumers regarding their services.</p>

                        <dt>Consumer Preferences</dt>
                        <dd>The API for the creation and management of consumer preference profiles offers SCRUD-like manipulation of preference profiles as well as operations useful to the graphical user-facing environment. Consumer preference management refers to the creation and maintenance of consumer preference profiles, where service consumers capture the relevant service selection criteria and the ranking preferences that should be used when PuLSaR generates recommendations.</dd>
                        <dt>Recommendations</dt>
                        <dd>he Recommendations Management API offers SCRUD-like manipulation of recommendations. Graphical user-facing environment uses only the search, retrieve and update operations, whereas the batch mode agent uses all operations offered. This API is used to request new recommendations and manage the existing (stored) recommendations. Recommendations can be requested either through the user-facing environment or they can be generated automatically in batch mode. Moreover, every time a service is being recommended a relevant notification is sent to the corresponding service provider.</dd>
                        <dt>Consumer Feedback</dt>
                        <dd>The Consumer feedback API offers SCRUD-like manipulation of consumer feedback through graphical user-facing environment and the batch mode agent. Feedback refers only to the imprecise attributes of services, which cannot be accurately or objectively measured by a software agent (e.g. service reputation). Feedback reflects the perceived value of a service according to the opinion of a cloud consumer who used it. Through this API the collected feedback can be used to calculate the average perceived value (of an imprecise service attribute), and when this is substantially different than the value stated in service description, a notification is generated and sent to the corresponding service provider.</dd>
                        <dt>Notifications</dt>
                        <dd>The Notification API offers notifications retrieval capability to the graphical user-facing environment. Notifications are generated (i) either when a provider’s service is being recommended to a consumer, or (ii) when feedback collected from consumers who have used a provider’s service, average to an (imprecise) attribute value substantially different than that stated in service description.</dd>

                        <dd>The Optimization Attribute Management API offers SCRUD-like manipulation of optimization attributes through the graphical user-facing environment.

Through this API administrators can modify and maintain the optimization attribute hierarchy and also map optimization attributes onto broker policy services properties.</dd>

                        <dd>The Optimization Attribute Mappings Management API offers SCRUD-like manipulation of the mappings through the graphical user-facing environment. This API is meant to be used by users with administrative role. Through this API administrators can create, modify and remove the mappings of optimization attributes and service classification dimensions of the broker policy.</dd>

The API broadcasts such recommendations as events through the pub/sub system API. Moreover, the API is used by consumers and providers to query the recommendations for a single service or set of services. The request consists of a set of services, and the response consists of a set of services to remove, a set of services to add, and the reason for the recommendation.</dd>

                        <dd>The recommendation history API is used by the optimisation mechanism PuLSaR to check if a service has been recommended to be removed within a specific timeframe. The request consists of a service and a timestamp, and the response consists of a set of consumer or provider names, who have been recommended to remove the service after the timestamp.</dd>

                        <dt>Dependency Checking API</dt>
                        <dd>The dependency checking API is used to complete a set of services based on their dependencies. The request consists of a set of services, and the response consists of another set of services, which need to be added to satisfy the dependencies. In other words, the union of the input and output services form a self-contained set, where no service in this set depends on any service outside this set.</dd>

                    <p>The topic-based pub/sub messaging paradigm allows subscribers to express their interest in an event topic. These subscribers are then notified of any event, generated by a publisher, that matches their registered interest. Publishers do not route their messages directly to specific subscribers. In fact, publishers do not have any prior knowledge of which these particular subscribers, if any, might be. Similarly, subscribers subscribe to one or more topics in a publisher-agnostic manner. Each subscription maintains its own queue; as messages pertaining to a particular topic are published, a copy of each message is placed on each relevant queue.</p>
